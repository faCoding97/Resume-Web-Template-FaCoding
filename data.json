    "headline": "ðŸ’¡ Full-Stack Developer ",
    "summary": "Iâ€™m a full-stack developer focused on building scalable, maintainable enterprise systems â€” the kind that run quietly and fast. Day-to-day, I ship with **.NET Core (Web API, MVC)** on the backend and **React / Next.js / Vue.js** on the frontend, styled with **Tailwind CSS** (and Kendo UI where it fits) to deliver clean, responsive UIs.\n\nOn the server side I lean on **layered architecture**, **Dependency Injection**, and **REST principles**, backed by **Entity Framework** and **SQL Server** â€” plus **MySQL** and **MongoDB** when the problem calls for it. Iâ€™ve delivered real-world **ERP / Inventory** and automation projects, including barcode and **QR** workflows, with an eye on performance, caching, and security hardening.\n\nI also explore **AI & ML** â€” using **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, and **OpenCV** â€” to add practical intelligence to products (from classic image processing to NLP and model-powered features). Iâ€™m comfortable wiring up service layers in **ASP.NET MVC / API** and spinning supporting services with **Node.js** and **Python** when needed.\n\nOps-wise, I keep things simple and reliable: **Docker**, Git workflows, and deployments to **Windows (IIS)** and **Linux**. Earlier in my journey I shipped several **Unity** (2D/3D, AR/VR) projects â€” that game-dev muscle still shapes how I debug, optimize, and design interactions â€” but my current focus is enterprise platforms and AI-driven systems that move the needle."
